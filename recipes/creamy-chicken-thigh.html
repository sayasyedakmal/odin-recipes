    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Skillet chicken thighs with a super easy and decadent sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 1½ tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and cut into strips</li>
        <li> 1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li> ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set an oven-proof skillet on high heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon oil and chicken. Cook until well seared,
            about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate and reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil, then add garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Bloom spices together for 1 minute.
            Pour in chicken broth, then add sun-dried tomatoes, and finally the cream. Stir well and then blend in
            Parmesan cheese. Bring to a light simmer. Add chicken back to the pan.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the preheated oven and bake, uncovered, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the
            juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
            least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly to let the sauce thicken before serving, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
